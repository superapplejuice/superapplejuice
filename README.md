# Hello! 🌊 #

My name is Jan Mathew and I'm currently a software engineer 🧑‍💻 with Epam Systems based in Singapore 🇸🇬! I've been working as a software engineer for 4 years.
I have experience with:
- TypeScript 🟦
- React + Nextjs 🧬
- Apollo + GraphQL 💞
- PostgreSQL 🐘

Outside of work, you will most likely find me doing one of the following in no particular order:
- Drumming 🥁
- Music production 🖥
- DJing 💽
- Minecraft 🌲
- MEMES ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

I'm always learning to improve my TypeScript skills because after jumping to it from JavaScript, I've become OBSESSESED 😱 with types!

See you around and stay safe always! 😷
